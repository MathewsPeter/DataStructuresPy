# List
Ordered collection of elements of same or different (data)type.
Each element is a reference(same as pointer in C) to the element.
So, list allows storage of any data type but is relatively slow and preferred for smaller number of elements.
No size limit.

count: returns number of elements
extend: append the elements of another list(or iterable) at the end of a list
