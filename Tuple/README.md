# Tuple
The name Tuple is derived from the generalisation of single, double, triple etc.

Ordered collection of elements of same or different (data)type.
Each element is a reference(same as pointer in C) to the element.
So, list allows storage of any data type but is relatively slow and preferred for smaller number of elements.
No size limit.


count: returns number of elements
index: returns index of an element
